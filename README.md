# ðŸ“Š JMeter Performance Testing  

##  Project Overview  
This repository contains **JMeter test plans** and a **performance report** used to evaluate system performance under different load conditions. The tests assess response times, error rates, and overall system reliability to ensure optimal performance.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Results  
The performance evaluation was conducted with specific **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**:  

- âœ… **Total Error Percentage**: **0.13%** (Passed, must be â‰¤ 10%)  
- âœ… **90% of Requests**: **â‰¤ 484 ms** (Passed, must be â‰¤ 3 seconds)  
- âœ… **99% of Requests**: **â‰¤ 830 ms** (Passed, must be â‰¤ 5 seconds)  

All SLAs were successfully met, confirming that the system performs efficiently under the tested load conditions.  

## How to Use  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GehadAshry/Performance-JMeter.git
2. **Open Apache JMeter**  and load any of the .jmx files.
3. **Configure** test parameters as needed.
4. **Run** the tests and analyze results in JMeterâ€™s Aggregate Report.
5. **Review** the Aggregate Report.pdf for a summary of the performance analysis.
